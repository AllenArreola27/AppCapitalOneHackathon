WHEN?

THEME
- "Changing Banking for Good"

PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Current banking application generally do not have a way to establish a budget/personal limit that a user may want to spend in a given month & users receive limited feedback through its notification system. 

PURPOSE
- Young adults have difficulty keeping a budget and often overspend. The new features would allow the user to have more control over their credit card use. We expect higher customer satisfaction in credit card experience because there is a higher sense of ownership and responsibility. 

APPLICATION FEATURES
- Ability to set and change monthly or weekly budget
- Push notification when an attempted purchase will cause the monthly limit to be exceeded (Prompt user to Approve/Deny, and clicking on the notification will show more details regarding budget/current balance)

FUTURE FEATURES
- Integration of back end and front end code into one single mobile application
- Spending limits for purchases from certain categories: Food, travel, Shopping, and more.  
- Distinction between credit and debit cards
